# AI-Assistant-Web-App-LangChain-Streamlit
This project implements a simple AI-powered assistant using Streamlit for a web-based interface and LangChain for managing interactions with an OpenAI-powered language model. The app allows users to input a query or prompt and receive a generated response. Below is an overview of the setup and functionality.

Setup and Dependencies:

    Install required libraries: streamlit and langchain_community.
    Configure the OPENAI_API_KEY for accessing the OpenAI API.

Streamlit Web Application:

    Title and Description: The application is titled "AI Assistant" and includes a brief explanation of its purpose.
    User Input: A text input box is provided for users to enter their prompt or question.
    Response Display: Once a prompt is submitted, the application generates and displays a response.

Language Model Integration:

    Prompt Engineering: A prompt template guides the assistant to provide helpful and reasonable answers.
    LLM Execution: Uses OpenAI's API (via LangChain) to generate responses based on user input.

Local Hosting and Public Access:
        
    The app runs locally using streamlit run app.py.
    Uses localtunnel to expose the app to the web, enabling public access via a secure URL.

Usage Example:

    Input a prompt like "What is the capital of France?".
    The app generates and displays an appropriate response, e.g., "The capital of France is Paris."

This project showcases the integration of Streamlit and LangChain for building user-friendly AI applications, enabling seamless interaction with state-of-the-art language models.
